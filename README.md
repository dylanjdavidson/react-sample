# React Sample

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I worked on this using:

- npm 6.14.12
- node 14.16.1
- Chrome browser
- `cors-anywhere` with PORT=1337

### To install

`npm install`

### To run

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Reflection

I feel pretty good about a majority of this sample, however I did run out of time and didn't get to finishing implementation of reordering in the saved list. I also put off quite a few CSS improvements, which I never got to either.

With more time, I would have definitely finished the reordering, updated the restaurant cards to make them look good, and added validation in lots of places (get an error when search for " " location).

With extra time, I would have added a search term input, made buttons looks nicer with icons, used typescript, and added the ability to get the user's location.
